# Coursera Algs4 Course in Python

Solving Algs4 course exercises using Python (instead of Java), thus reimplementing also the already presented API (or using what already Python offers).

For this project, I am going to use [ITU Algs4](https://github.com/itu-algorithms/itu.algs4) implementation. Thanks to those authors for having ported the already well known library to Python.
